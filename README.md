> **trustBank Mobile** — the companion app for the trustBank crypto-first neobank, built to make sending, receiving, and converting cryptocurrency as intuitive as sending a text message.

## 🚀 Project Overview

trustBank Mobile is the open source React Native application that powers trustBank’s crypto to fiat and fiat to crypto flows on iOS. It features:

- **Multi-Asset Wallets** — 85+ cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, SOL, NGN and more).  
- **Seamless Conversion** — swap crypto to Naira (and vice versa) in two taps.  
- **Robust Security** — built in encryption, biometrics, and secure storage.  
- **Clean, Accessible UI** — powered by shadcn-ui and Tailwind CSS.
